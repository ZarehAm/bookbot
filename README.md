# bookbot
BookBot is my first git project!

BookBot takes the text of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" and prints a report detailing:
- total word count
- frequency of occurrence of alpha characters within the book

The code can be easily modified for any other book (or .txt file) by simply modifying line 9 with the correct PATH,
and line 12 with the updated name of the document.

Thank you for taking the time to view my first git project.
